Development of a body fat calculator

## Description

Do research and analysis on a real data set to find a reliable method to estimate percentage of body fat using clinically available measurement.

## Contents

### Summary

* This repository contains a README file, our report summary, and three directories named: Codes, Data and Images.
* The Images directory contains the plots and graphs we used during our analysis and modeling, which are generated by R codes in the Codes directory.
* The Data directory contains the original data file we got (BodyFat.csv) and the cleaned data file (df1_v2.csv) which we used R code to clean and process.
* The Codes directory has two sub-directories:
    1. model: this directory contains all the codes we wrote to do data cleaning, analysis and modeling. We include our codes in the R Markdown files for better readability and visualization.
    2. shiny: this directory contains the shiny web app codes (app.R) and the cleaned data file we would use in this app. This app is developed to design a body fat percentage calculator based on our analysis and model. Users can easily use it by inputting some information about them. You can download it and run it in RStudio. Or, we have already deployed it to shinyapps.io, so you can access it using the following link https://jameswanjh.shinyapps.io/bodyfat/ in your browser for convienience.

### Usage

* All of our codes in this repository can be run by RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/), including the R program and R Markdown (Rmd) files.
* You can download RStudio by the following link: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/.
